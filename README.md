This is the last project for the Android Beginner Scholarship with Udacity. 
The project is about creating a Quiz App. The questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons. 
I made the quiz using CardView. When you finish the quiz there is a try again button, which resets the app in the initial state. 
I put some screenshots with how the app looks in the screenshots directory.
